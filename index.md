title: AStar Algorithm C++ Project
---

Welcome to my AStar Algorithm C++ Project , where l use the algorithm to find the cheapest way to reach the path. This project demonstrates how the algorithm calculates the the different paths and chooses the one that best fits. This project idea demonstrates the implementation and testing of the A* pathfinding algorithm in a 5x5 grid using modern C++ in Visual Studio.
